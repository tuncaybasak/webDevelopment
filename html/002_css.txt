== CSS ==

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, 
what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

= Inline CSS =
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

= Internal CSS = 
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>

= External CSS =
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
