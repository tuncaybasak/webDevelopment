= HTML Iframes =
An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

<iframe src="url" title="description">
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:none;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:2px solid red;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

= HTML Layout Elements =
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

= HTML Layout Techniques =
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:
CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid

= CSS framework =
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

= CSS Float Layout =
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. 
Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.

= CSS Flexbox Layout =
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

= CSS Grid Layout =
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
