= What is HTTP =
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

= HTTP Methods =
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS

= GET =
GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

= POST =
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2

POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

= PUT =
is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. 
In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

= HEAD =
is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.
In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.
HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body.

= DELETE =
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

= OPTIONS =
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

= GET vs. POST =
The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.

GET                                                             POST
Can be cached                                                   Not cached
Parameters remain in browser history                            Parameters are not saved in browser history
URL is limited max 2048                                         No restrictions
Only ASCII characters allowed                                   No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed
less secure because data sent is part of the URL                a little safer parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs
