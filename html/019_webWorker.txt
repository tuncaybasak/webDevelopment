= HTML Web Workers API =
A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. 
You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:
The window object
The document object
The parent object

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Count numbers: <output id="result"></output></p>
<button onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button> 
<button onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support Web Workers.</p>

<script>
var w;

function startWorker() {
  if(typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
    if(typeof(w) == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
    }
    w.onmessage = function(event) {
      document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
  } else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers...";
  }
}

function stopWorker() { 
  w.terminate();
  w = undefined;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

= demo_workers.js =
var i = 0;

function timedCount() {
  i = i + 1;
  postMessage(i);
  setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
}

timedCount();
